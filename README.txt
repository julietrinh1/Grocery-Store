Home Page
---------
The name chosen for the grocery store is Grocery Store Online (GSO), and the design of the whole project was inspired by many examples of grocery store websites like IGA, Metro, and Super C. The navigation bar on top of each page gives a professional esthetic to the website and allows the user to navigate through it easily. The home page gives the choice to the user whether to access different aisles with the navigation bar or with representative images found under the header of the page. Below are included some examples of weekly deals that give direct access to each product presented. Then, like with any other grocery store website, the user can enter his personal email to suscribe to weekly deals notifications. The footer of the page is the same for all pages of the website, and in there, the user can find a link to the backstore part of GSO, the team members' names who worked on this project, and some static elements to complete the look of the page.

Aisle/Product Pages
-------------------
The aisle pages present four products of particular type each, and link these products to their own page with a small summary (weight, price, name). Buttons to add the product to the cart are available to the user as well, and another link which would normally give the user a description of the product is found just below. Other related products are presented at the bottom of the page and the user can access each on of them with a siple click on the image.

Sign In/Sign Up Pages
---------------------
In the navigation bar, there is a section that says "Account" which has two links: one to the sign in page and the other to the sign up page. On the sign in page, the user can enter his username (email) and his password before logging in with the "Sign In" button. The functionality "Show Password" is available to the user as well if he wants to make sure he made no mistake in there. A link for the forgot password is placed under the button, but it is not linked to any other page at the moment. The sign up page, on the other hand, asks the user to enter all his personal information necessary to create his account which could be stored on a server later. Textfields for the name, the password, the email, and the postal code as well as the radio type input for gender can be found there. The user has to check the box saying that he agrees to the terms of service of GSO, and "Terms of Service" is directly linked to a page with generic conditions of use. The buttons "Reset" and "Create Account" are placed at the bottom of the form.

Shopping Cart
-------------
To access the shopping cart, the user can cick on the icon in the right top corner. There are set some examples of products that were added to the cart, and the quantity of each one of them can be changed with buttons. A small icon of a garbage can would be the button to remove a product from the shopping cart. On the right side of the page, the user can see a summary of all the products in his shopping cart as well as the total price he would have to pay. The buttons "CONTINUE SHOPPING", "CHECK OUT", and the one for the donation (Covid-19 cause) are pretty much self-explanatory.

Product List
------------
The product list in the backstore part of the website, lists all products available in the store with a global summary for each one of them. The static buttons to filter the products, to edit their summary or delete them completely can be found on this page as well. A search bar that we can see on top of the list would allow the user to search for the desired product later. Another button present on the product list page is the "Add Product" button, and it gives a direct access to a different page in which the user would be able to give the title of the product, associate it to a category of products, give the supplier, add the quantity stored, decide of the price, give a description, and even upload an image of the product from his personal computer.

Order List
----------
In the order list, examples of different orders are given with essential information like the date of the purchase, the name of the buyer, the subtotal, the profit to the store, and the order's status. Buttons "View" and "Ship" allow the user to have some control over the order. The "View" button is linked to another page where the whole information about the buyer's profile is shown as well as the shipping address and the order's summary that can be altered by the user. The buttons "Cancel" and "Save" on the top of the order will be implemented later.

User List
---------
The user list allows the user to see all the accounts created by customers, and buttons "Edit" and "Delete" will give some control over the list later. The "Add User" button, on the other hand is linked to a page which would allow to enter all necessary information to create a new account.
